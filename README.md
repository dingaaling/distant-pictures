# distant-pictures
A simple server that serves webcam pictures to a website. 

When the user clicks take picture, a regular high quality picture is taken. If the user instead presses the button controlled by the Arduino, a lower quality photo is taken. Lastly, if the user presses LED ON/OFF the Arduino light turns on and off.
